# Day 1: Dive!

## Run

```
cat assets/input.txt | cargo run
```

## Bench

```
cat assets/input.txt | cargo bench
```

## Log

Used bitwise operators here. Unfortunately, the result is a big mess. 
Hopefully I won't have to come back to this code again.

Local benchmark results:

* parse: 25 μs
* part 1: 27 μs
* part 2: 86 μs
